## Addvent of Code 2018 Nim

I have been wanting to learn Nim for a while now since it is a promising new language that does a lot of things the way I like.

The best way for me to pick up a new language is to jump right in and solve some problems, and thankfully it is December 2018 and Advent of Code is putting out a ton of cool problems to solve this month.

The problems are on the [AOC website](https://adventofcode.com/2018/).

### Dependencies
 - The Nim compiler is installed and in your path
 - The Nimble package manager is installed and in your path

### Installation
Install the above dependencies and then hop over to the shell to run:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NickMyers217/advent_of_code_2018_nim
$ cd advent_of_code_2018_nim
$ nimble test
```

That will run the tests which print out all of the answers.
